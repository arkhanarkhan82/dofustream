<h3><strong>How We Work</strong></h3>
<p>We do&nbsp;<strong>not</strong>&nbsp;host or store any video content or streaming media on our website.

<p>We&nbsp;<strong>strictly</strong>&nbsp;advise our users to watch matches through legal streaming platforms and avoid any copyrighted content. While we do not host any videos or streams ourselves, the links provided on our platform lead to third-party sources that may host the streams. If you have concerns regarding copyright materials, we recommend checking the&nbsp;<strong>embed link</strong>&nbsp;from the page's source code and reaching out to the original video hosting website for resolution.</p>
<p>Additionally, any advertisements displayed inside the media player&nbsp;<strong>do not belong to us</strong>. The ad revenue generated within the video player is solely managed by the site that originally hosted the video.</p>
